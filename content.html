    <h3> MY PROJECT EXPERIENCES</h3>
    <p>
        First : As I entered my college I heard my seniors always used to say explore different fields and choose one. 
        But still I am exploring different fields and making myself confident and even more better.
        As my first step I started with Machine Learning and that proved to be very interesting for me.
        I started with the most famous Andrew Ng course and then started making ML projects (just basic ones).
        This was my first project making experience and I as extremely overwhelmed see my project.</br>
    </br>
</br>
        Second : I developed these projects basic projects furthur and made them advanced.</br>
    </br>
</br>
        Third : I joined 30 days of Web Dev course and explored a new field of web development. This really helped me a lot.
        I was curious to complete my projects and learn new things. The projects were also good and helped me to complete my own website Even a discord channel was created which 
        helped us to solve our doubts and move forward. Overall it was a great experience.</br>
